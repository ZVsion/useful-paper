Instance Embedding Transfer to Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00908v1.pdf))

evaluate: **Instance Networks**. instance embedding vector for each pixel; instance embeddings allow us to link objects together over time. we adapt the instance networks trained on static images to video object segmentation and **incorporate the embeddings with objectness and optical flow features, without model retraining or online fine-tuning.**
